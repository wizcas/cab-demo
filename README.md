# cab-demo

A demo app for fast developing the app bridge features in **Glide**
without having to start a local copy of Glide Digital Ads.

This app simulates the functionalities on the **embedded** app's side,
such as triggering parent navigation, subscribing to the auth action,
etc., so that the developer can focus on the **parent** implementation.

## Quick Start Locally

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`
3. Use `http://localhost:9527` as the embedded URL.
